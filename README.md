# Emoji Encryptor

## Description
The "Emoji Encryptor" project is a tool for encrypting and decrypting text messages using a unique combination of a permutation cipher and emoji substitution. This method provides a secure way of communication that's difficult to decipher without the key.

## How It Works
1. Input the text message you want to encrypt.
2. The program applies a permutation algorithm to the text of the message.
3. After permutation, each character of the text is replaced with a corresponding emoji according to the selected substitution table.
4. The resulting encrypted message in the form of an emoji sequence is ready to be sent.

## Installation
To install and run the project, follow these commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emoji-encryptor.git
cd emoji-encryptor
python setup.py install
